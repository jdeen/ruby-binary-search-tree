# BinarySearchTree

Welcome to yet another Binary Search Tree implementation using Ruby. I wrote this library to accompany a blog post
I am writing. I hope you found this useful. Since its over 10 years since I learnt BST, I could get the theory wrong.
In that case I do appreciate if you could correct me.

## Installation & Usage

Binary Search Tree is basic data structure in computer-science. This repo acts as reference to an implementation of the
data structure. This, this library is not intended to be published to RubyGems or installed locally. How ever, as a
student you can clone the repository, inspect and modify for your educational purposes.

```
cd /path/to/test/projects
git clone git@github.com:jdeen/ruby-binary-search-tree.git
cd ruby-binary-search-tree
bundle
```

You can use the console app to interact with the app. You can check the `specs/binary_search_tree` folder to inspect
the tests on how you use the code.

```
./bin/console
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can
also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the
version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version,
push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
